# Contributing to SineRider

(Tentative - needs a rewrite eventually)

SineRider is a platform for playing, making and sharing interesting math puzzles â€” however, at its heart, it is really a platform for cultivating passion for math and computing through providing a means to play and tinker with those two things _hands-on_. Both through being itself a game about composing functions to achieve certain behavior _but also_ through making the code for said game to the community open-source. By that token, feel free to read through the codebase, see how things work, play around, open PRs or, if you're feeling adventerous, join the community (among many others) at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) ~~and become a full-fledged contributor~~.
